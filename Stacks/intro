  STACK:- stores a list of items in which an item can be added to or removed from the list only at  one end.

  char :- linear data structure, in which we can store list of items.

  special :- LIFO mechenism;

  LIFO(Last In First Out) :- we can only remove the element first which we added recently in stack;

                             |   |                |   |
                       top-> | 3 |           push | 4 |
                             |___|            <-- |___|
                             |   |        |   |
                             | 2 |        | 2 |
                             |___|        |___|
                             |   |        |   |
                             | 1 |        | 1 |
                             |___|        |___|
                                          |   |
                                          | 1 |
                                          |___|

   top -> top is a pointer which shows the recently added element.

  There are some operation which we can perform in stacks

  1. push(); -> To add an elements on the top of the stacks.
  2. pop();  -> To pop out an element from the top of the stack.
  3. Top();  -> To call the element placed on top of stack with the help of this function.
  4. empty();-> To check if the stack is empty or not.
