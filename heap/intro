Heap:- A complete binary tree that satisfy heaps property.

properties:- if heap has n nodes then it has a height of log(n)

                50
                /\               this is max heap means the parent node have to be greater then child nodes
            40     45              we will traverse up to down and left to right
            /\     /\
          30  20 35  10

          representation in array:- a = | 50 | 40 | 45 | 30 | 20 | 35 | 10 |
                                           1    2    3    4    5    6    7

                      node = i
                      parent(i) = i/2
                      left_child(i) = 2*i
                      right_child = 2*i+1
