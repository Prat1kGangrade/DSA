                                 ##QUEUE##

   Queue:- stores a list of items in which an item can be insert at one end and removed
                             from the other end only.

    Based on the principle of FIFO (First In First out)

                 operations:-

                 we have to make two pointers (front and back)

                 front is pointing on first element of the QUEUE
                 back is pointing on last element of the QUEUE

          enqueue(x); = like a push operation (push element at the back of the queue)
          dequeue();  = like a pop operation (pop element from front position of the queue)
          peek();     = to check the value at front
          empty();    = to check queue is empty or not
